                    "Before you start looking for homes, it’s smart to get a pre-approval letter from your lender. You want to set yourself up to be the strongest buyer possible—the person the seller absolutely wants to deal with. And it’s important to understand that to a seller, a lender’s pre-approval letter is considerably stronger than a pre-qualification letter. When a seller knows your financing is secure, your offer is taken more seriously.",
                    "To get pre-approved, you fill out an application with information including your name, current income and assets to determine how much you can reasonably afford. You’ll be asked for your Social Security Number to run a credit check, and we’ll provide you a summary of the report. With our Digital Mortgage , this can all be done in about 10 to 15 minutes on your phone or computer, and if you ever get stuck, just call the number on the screen. If your completed application is approved, you can contact your loan officer to get a pre-approval letter that can be shared with your agent. In a strong seller’s market like the one we’re in now, a letter can mean the difference between having your offer accepted or rejected.",
