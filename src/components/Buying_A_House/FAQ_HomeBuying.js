Conventional wisdom would say you should avoid PMI at all costs, but the tradeoff isn’t so bad. On the one hand, you could spend years saving up for a down payment, but you would only delay building equity in a new home. Real estate prices may go up during that time, forcing you to save even more money or settle for a less expensive house. Accumulating equity and wealth through homeownership as soon as possible generally outstrips the added cost of PMI over the long haul."
