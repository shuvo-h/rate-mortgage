This constant flux forces mortgage interest rates up and down along with the latest economic trends. This constant ebb and flow of the housing economy constantly opens new windows of opportunity for buyers to invest in a home.",

As a result, these borrowers are free to pursue their long-term financial goals with confidence that their mortgage payments will not be altered.",

Even if the economy falters and rates skyrocket again, a 15-year mortgage structure protects your minimum payment and will not change throughout the life of the loan.",
    
        "A longer term plan, such as a 30-year fixed mortgage, can offer the same certainty, but will end up costing the borrower more in interest, as the repayment plan is twice as long.

Calculated as a percentage of the full mortgage loan, the interest rate outlines the annual cost of financing a home purchase. Charging interest on a loan is a lender’s way of ensuring returns by mitigating some of the uncertainty around issuing a mortgage while giving the lender a return on the money that was lent.",

This means that selling the home after only five years likely won’t allow you to profit from your real estate investment.",

During the latter half of your lending agreement, you’ll gain more equity with each monthly mortgage payment as the remaining balance on your loan dwindles.",
