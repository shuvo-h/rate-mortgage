      <h2>5-year ARM rates vs. 15-year fixed mortgage rates</h2>

      <p>
        The 15-year fixed rate mortgage remains a popular choice for those willing to absorb higher monthly 
        payments for a chance to more quickly pay off their debt. Let’s see how it compares to a 5-year ARM:
      </p>

      <p>
        Both the 15-year fixed rate mortgage and the 5-year ARM offer borrowers an opportunity to receive 
        lower-than-average interest rates. However, frequently the 15-year fixed rate is lower than available 
        rates for a 5/1 or 5/6 ARM. In addition, with a 15-year mortgage, you are on an amortization schedule 
        designed to pay off your entire loan + interest in 15 years. That means higher monthly payments no 
        matter how low the interest rate. For individuals with a solid income and proven creditworthiness, a 
        condensed payment schedule might be preferable. It’s always wise to run through the various scenarios 
        on a mortgage calculator to see if you are comfortable with the estimated payments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, much like the 30-year fixed rate, the 15-year fixed rate mortgage provides the borrower 
        with predictability . In a world of variable rates and changing costs, this can be a highly sought 
        after commodity. Unfortunately, a 5-year ARM does not offer predictability. The mortgage rate during 
        the adjustable period of the loan, while tempered by margins, could still fluctuate upwards and could 
        cost you hundreds of extra dollars per year in payments. It could also result in hundreds of dollars 
        per year in savings—or more. With an ARM, the potential to leverage variability for savings is an 
        acceptable built-in risk. But this is true for select individuals only.

      <h2 id="5yearmakeSense">When a 5-year ARM makes sense</h2>

      <p>
        In a sense all ARMs are hybrid loans, meaning each distinct one is designed with elements of both a 
        fixed rate and an adjustable rate. That said, people choose ARMs—particularly a 5-year ARM—because of 
        the typical introductory low rate that could generate enough up-front savings to make up for whatever 
        comes next. And these days, most homeowners transition out of an ARM in advance of confronting its 
        full effects. They either sell or refinance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many are first-time homebuyers who are getting their finances together and preparing for a bigger 
        purchase later on; these homeowners typically exit the ARM by selling after five years of generally 
        lower interest rates. Some intend to refinance and transition to a fixed rate. Whatever the exact 
        context may be, if the potential for frontloaded savings are a priority, why not choose the ARM with 
        a great introductory interest rate? This is the allure of the 5-year ARM.
