This constant flux forces mortgage interest rates up and down along with the latest economic trends. This constant ebb and flow of the housing economy constantly opens new windows of opportunity for buyers to invest in a home.",

As a result, these borrowers are free to pursue their long-term financial goals with confidence that their mortgage payments will not be altered.",
    
        "When interest rates drop, savvy buyers who recognize the benefits of fixed rate loans might seize the timing and apply for a 15-year fixed rate mortgage.",

Even if the economy falters and rates skyrocket again, a 15-year mortgage structure protects your minimum payment and will not change throughout the life of the loan.",
    
        "A longer term plan, such as a 30-year fixed mortgage, can offer the same certainty, but will end up costing the borrower more in interest, as the repayment plan is twice as long. Although the scheduled monthly payments are higher for 15-year mortgages, you’ll end up paying less in interest when the loan is fully paid off.",

        "This predictability allows lenders to build a repayment plan known as an amortization schedule. Amortization refers to the process of steadily paying off a debt through regular payments over a period of time. For a fixed rate mortgage, building an amortization schedule is much simpler thanks to the locked-in interest rate and monthly minimum."

    title: "What’s the difference between fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages?",
    list: [
        "Unlike a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) come with a fluctuating interest rate that rises or lowers along with market conditions.",

        "Minimum monthly payments on these loans depend on external factors, and opting for this mortgage type is usually seen as a greater risk. When mortgage interest rates go up, so do the monthly payments on an ARM.",

        "Homeowners can’t control the economy or shift the real estate market. If you apply for an ARM and these factors turn against your favor, you could end up paying thousands more in added interest after the ARM expires.",

        "This also makes it difficult to predict how much money you’ll have for other expenses down the line. If the amount of interest suddenly spikes after your 5-year or 7-year ARM adjusts, you’ll have to adjust your finances. This makes ARMs a much more volatile lending option than 30-year fixed rate mortgages.",

        "The major advantage of an adjustable rate mortgage is that you could end up saving money over time. The initial interest rates on these loans are typically lower than their fixed rate counterparts. If the mortgage rates continue to dip after the fixed rate period on your ARM expires and your rate adjusts, your rate could decrease even further, lowering your monthly mortgage payments.",

        "Again, this depends entirely on the state of the economy and market trends. In addition to paying a steady rate of interest, 30-year fixed rate mortgages offer a number of financial advantages."
