                <p className={text_container}>The 30-year mortgage is the go-to home loan for many mortgage providers — and for good reason. A conventional 30-year fixed rate mortgage combines affordability with predictability. Over the course of your 30-year home loan, you can rest easy knowing your monthly mortgage payments will never change. Extending a mortgage over such a long period of time helps keep your housing costs down, which is why 30-year fixed rate mortgages are so popular with homeowners.</p>

                <p className={text_container}>Want to pay off your home loan quicker so you can own your house free and clear in less time than a 30-year mortgage? Your amortization schedule will be cut in half with a 15-year fixed rate mortgage. Your monthly payments will be higher compared with a 30-year mortgage due to the significantly shorter loan term. On the plus side, though, lenders often offer lower interest rates on 15-year mortgages, so you’ll pay less over the long run.</p>
