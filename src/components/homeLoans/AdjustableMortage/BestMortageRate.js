        finance a home purchase. And many prospective homeowners find this variety useful. Purchasing a home and 
        arranging a way to pay for it is one of the most momentous decisions you’ll ever make, and it should always

        Finding the best mortgage rate on the market is a process that begins long before you sit down with a loan 
        officer. Establishing creditworthiness, which tracks your ability to borrow and repay debts on time and 
        includes your credit score, is foundational to your pursuit of obtaining superior rates, and is best 
        achieved through years of careful credit maintenance and timely payments.

        The other half of the equation is going out into the world of banks and mortgage providers and finding a 
        trusted and professional lender who will give you the best deal based on a range of factors including your 
        credit, income, home price and down payment. This is your chance to explore different mortgage products, 
        ask questions and try to enhance your mortgage IQ as you seek to better understand the current mortgage 
        rate environment. The more prepared and knowledgeable you are, the better chance of obtaining a superior 
        mortgage rate.
