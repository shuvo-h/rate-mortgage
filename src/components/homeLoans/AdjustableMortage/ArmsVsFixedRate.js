      <h2>ARMs vs. fixed rate mortgages</h2>

      <p>
        If you had to boil down the difference between an ARM and a fixed rate mortgage, the one word that 
        would be most applicable is “risk.” ARMs by their very nature are financial products vulnerable to shifts 
        in market conditions—conditions that can’t be predicted five, seven or 10 years into the future. 
        This uncertainty provides risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, this uncertainty can also provide potential benefits. Since the future is unwritten, rates 
        could just as conceivably drop as they could increase. Even if they stay flat or tick up a little, the 
        built-in savings of the initial fixed rate period can result in lower overall payments than many fixed 
        rate mortgages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Conventional 15-year and 30-year fixed rate mortgage options are at the polar end of risk. They provide 
        the homeowner with steady, consistent interest payments that do not change. They are great loans for the 
        risk-averse individual.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interestingly, while ARMs typically feature more attractive rates on the front end of their products, 
        recent market conditions have significantly closed the gap so that fixed rate loans remain highly 
        competitive even given the ARM’s low initial rate. Generally speaking, when interest rates are low, 
        the argument for an ARM is more difficult to make.
