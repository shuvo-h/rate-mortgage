When weighing your refinance options, look beyond the lump sum payment itself and factor in every cost and savings opportunity.",

Doing so will also result in lower monthly mortgage installments, which could put even more money back into your bank account at the end of the day. A cash-out refi calculator will narrow the scope of your search a bit, but you’re best served by speaking with a refinance expert.",
